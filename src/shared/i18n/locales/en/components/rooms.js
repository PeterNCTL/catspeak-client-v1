    // This tool call only supports file replacement. I will do i18n updates in separate calls or use multiple `replace_file_content` calls serially in my list?
    // I can only do one replacement per tool call for `replace_file_content`.
    // I'll start with updating the Modal to use the structure, and I'll see what label I can use.
    // Actually, I can use "Room Name" hardcoded? No, improper.
    // I will verify the i18n files again.
    // En: `namePlaceholder: "e.g. Chill Practice"`.
    // I'll add `nameLabel` to the i18n files first.

    // Wait, I can't put comments in the replacement.
    // I will start by updating the component to move labels out, using `namePlaceholder` as the label for now (since that was the behavior before, just moved position) to keep it safe, OR better: use `namePlaceholder` as placeholder and "Room Name" as label.
    // Given strict instructions "no custom uis", "barebone mui", "change the label to be outside".
    // Moving "e.g. Chill Practice" to be a label *above* the input seems weird if it's an example.
    // The previous code had: `label={t.rooms.createRoom.namePlaceholder}`.
    // So the floating label was "e.g. Chill Practice".
    // I will follow the pattern.
    // However, standard UI is Label: [Input (placeholder)].
    // I will try to make it nice.
    // `t.rooms.createRoom.title` is "What's your room name?".
    // I'll use "Room name" for the label.
    // I will update i18n files.

    // Step 1: Add `nameLabel` to En, Vi, Zh.
    // Step 2: Update `CreateRoomModal`.

    // I will combine these into the sequence.
    // First En.
